## Client Issues

It would not be a critique of League of Legends if we did not talk about the League client. Since the beginning of time, League players have complained about the constant bugs and **usability** issues of the client. While we could go on and on about all the problems with the League client, I will instead focus on one particularly distasteful aspect of the client.

When in a lobby to queue with other players, one might wish to look at the profile of the people they are about to play with. You would think that an effective way to accomplish this task would be to click on the player and then click on a button such as "view profile" and then be shown their profile, but you would be wrong. Clicking on the big title cards belonging to each player does nothing. There are only 2 ways you can look up a player's profile using the league client.

The first method is using the friends tab. If the user is a friend, you can find them in your friends list and then view their profile through there. This does not work for viewing profiles of players that are not on your friends list, nor are friends that you are in a party with moved to the top of your friends list.

The second method is by going through your own profile. Not only is this neither **effective** nor immediately clear to a new user, but it also isn't very prominent on the profile page (You can see the search bar on the top right). The search also doesn't offer suggestions, and usernames are case sensitive, so even a small typo will only result in the error message "Could not find a summoner by that name." This is a very poor way of preventing user **errors**.

The problem with both of these methods are that they are neither **effective** nor **learnable**. A simple and effective way for a player to view anothers profile would be to let them do it by selecting their card. Requiring the user to navigate through other menus or submenus increases the learning curve of this task.
