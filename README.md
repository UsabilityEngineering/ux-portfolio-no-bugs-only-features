# Dylan's UX Portfolio

Hi I'm Dylan Wright, a Computer Science major at Chico State. This is my user experience portfolio, where I'll be learning the ideas I'll need to use to make things more usable for users to use. In my free time you can find me at the river, on my paddleboard or on the shore, usually with a fishing pole. Here's a picture of a chameleon, because they're cool and weird like me:
